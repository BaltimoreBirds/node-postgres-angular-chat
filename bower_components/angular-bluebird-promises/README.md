This is a drop in replacement for $q that makes the bluebird API compatible with angulars subset of $q then simply swaps it out.

With this module you can use all of bluebirds additional promise methods on the $q service, the full list can be found here:

https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/blob/master/API.md

## Installation

The library depends on angularJS and Bluebird.

It is recommended that you install the library and its dependencies through bower:

```
bower install --save angular-bluebird-promises
```

You will then need to include the JS files for the plugin:

```
<script src="bower_components/bluebird/js/browser/bluebird.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/angular/angular.min.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/angular-bluebird-promises/dist/angular-bluebird-promises.min.js">
```

And finally add the module dependency in your AngularJS app:

```javascript
angular.module('myApp', ['mwl.bluebird']);
```

Alternatively you can install through npm:
```
npm install --save angular-bluebird-promises
```

Then add as a dependency to your app:

```javascript
angular.module('myApp', [require('angular-bluebird-promises')]);
```

By default the value of onPossiblyUnhandledRejection is set to angular.noop. You **can and should** override this with your own handler in order to catch uncaught errors. For example:

```javascript
angular.module('mwl.bluebird').run(function($q, $log) {
  $q.onPossiblyUnhandledRejection(function(err) {
    $log.warn('Unhandled rejection', err);
  });
});
```

## Usage

Simply use $q as you normally would. It will function exactly as before, however you will now have bluebirds additional API methods available as well on all promises throughout your angular app.

## Example

```javascript
angular.module('mwl.example', ['mwl.bluebird']).run(function($q, $http) {

    var promises = [
        $http.get('test/angular.json'),
        $http.get('test/bluebird.json')
    ];

    //Note the use of spread which isn't available normally on $q
    $q.all(promises).spread(function(angular, bluebird) {

        console.info('\\m/ It worked! \\m/', angular.data.name, bluebird.data.name);

    }).catch(console.error);

});
```

## Development

### Prepare your environment
* Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and NPM (should come with)
* Install local dev dependencies: `npm install` while current directory is this repo

### Build
Run `npm run build` to build the project files in the dist folder

### Development server
Run `npm start` to start a development server with auto reload that will also run unit tests
